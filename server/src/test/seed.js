		description: "Growing up in Tucson, my fondest memories are the days spent with my father, going to the classic barber shops for a hair cut. I keenly remember the sights and smells of Nickâ€™s Barbershop and the real experience of being a boy among men. It was a place that we could go together and do more than just get a hair cut. It was a place that made lasting memories.",
